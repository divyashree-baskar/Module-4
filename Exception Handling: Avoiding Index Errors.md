# Exception Handling in Python: Avoiding Index Errors

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list `list1` with some integer elements.
2. Use a **try-except** block:
   - In the `try` block, attempt to access an index that is out of range (e.g., `list1[5]`).
   - In the `except` block, catch the error and print a custom message `"You're out of list range"`.
3. Print the result based on whether the index access succeeds or fails.

## 🧾 Program
```
n=int(input())
a=[]
for i in range(n):
    l=int(input())
    a.append(l)

print(a)
try:
    print(a[6])
except Indexerror:
    print("6 is not accepted")

```
## Output
<img width="1212" height="563" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e08850a-f975-4d6d-83c5-d496ce1f7e63" />

## Result
Thus the program has been successfully executed.
